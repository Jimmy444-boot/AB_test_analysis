# AB_test_analysis

In this analysis, I conducted an AB test analysis on a company sales website.

The sales website has two versions of both Black friday and new_year campaign.

The importance of the AB test was to statistical identify which version was better 
I.e between version 1 and version 2 of both campaigns which is better best on the coversion rate. 

Sql was used to extract necessary information from the database.

Please follow this this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z3K-crqhsnKbn-mDn1L4K_Q6mPancaSyI9e4TMgB5KE/edit?usp=sharing 
to see how the AB test was conducted as well as the result of my AB test on the sales website.

In the google, a binomial calculator was built for AB test calculator. this calculator was used to derive my result.
